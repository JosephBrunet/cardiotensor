# Getting Technical

This section provides a deeper understanding of how `cardiotensor` works, including coordinate systems, angle definitions, structure tensor theory, and tractography method. It is intended for advanced users and developers.

## Topics Covered

- [Conventions](./conventions.md)  

- [Structure Tensor](./structure-tensor.md): Mathematical background on the structure tensor, eigen decomposition, and FA calculation.

- [Angle Definitions](./angles.md)  
  Detailed explanation of helix and intrusion angles

- [Fractional Anisotropy](./fractional-anisotropy.md)  
  How FA is computed and interpreted from the eigenvalues of the structure tensor.

- [Tractography](./tractography.md)  
  Streamline generation from 3D eigenvector fields and parameters for controlling seeding, step size, and thresholds.
