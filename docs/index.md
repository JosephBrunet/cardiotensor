# CardioTensor

**CardioTensor** is a Python package designed to compute and analyze 3D cardiomyocyte orientations in high-resolution heart images. This documentation provides a detailed guide on installation, usage, and contributing to the project.

## Features

- Automated orientation analysis
- Configurable workflows with `.conf` files
- Analysis of the transmural profile
- Export support for visualization tools like Amira and VTK

---

## Modules

- Orientation : Main module of cardiotensor, it

!!! note

    The structure tensor calculation is performed using the [`structure-tensor`](https://github.com/Skielex/structure-tensor) python package. This package allows GPU implementation using CUDA and [CuPy](https://github.com/cupy/cupy).
