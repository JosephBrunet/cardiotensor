              Background Current clinical imaging modalities such as CT and MRI provide resolution adequate to diagnose cardiovascular diseases but cannot depict detailed structural features in the heart across length scales. Hierarchical phase-contrast tomography (HiP-CT) uses fourth-generation synchrotron sources with improved x-ray brilliance and high energies to provide micron-resolution imaging of intact adult organs with unprecedented detail. Purpose To evaluate the capability of HiP-CT to depict the macro- to microanatomy of structurally normal and abnormal adult human hearts ex vivo. Materials and Methods Between February 2021 and September 2023, two adult human donor hearts were obtained, fixed in formalin, and prepared using a mixture of crushed agar in a 70\% ethanol solution. One heart was from a 63-year-old White male without known cardiac disease, and the other was from an 87-year-old White female with a history of multiple known cardiovascular pathologies including ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. Nondestructive ex vivo imaging of these hearts without exogenous contrast agent was performed using HiP-CT at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. Results HiP-CT demonstrated the capacity for high-spatial-resolution, multiscale cardiac imaging ex vivo, revealing histologic-level detail of the myocardium, valves, coronary arteries, and cardiac conduction system across length scales. Virtual sectioning of the cardiac conduction system provided information on fatty infiltration, vascular supply, and pathways between the cardiac nodes and adjacent structures. HiP-CT achieved resolutions ranging from gross (isotropic voxels of approximately 20 µm) to microscopic (approximately 6.4-µm voxel size) to cellular (approximately 2.3-µm voxel size) in scale. The potential for quantitative assessment of features in health and disease was demonstrated. Conclusion HiP-CT provided high-spatial-resolution, three-dimensional images of structurally normal and diseased ex vivo adult human hearts. Whole-heart image volumes were obtained with isotropic voxels of approximately 20 µm, and local regions of interest were obtained with resolution down to 2.3–6.4 µm without the need for sectioning, destructive techniques, or exogenous contrast agents.

	abstract = {Diffusion MRI provides unique information on the structure, organization, and integrity of the myocardium without the need for exogenous contrast agents. Diffusion MRI in the heart, however, has proven technically challenging because of the intrinsic non‐rigid deformation during the cardiac cycle, displacement of the myocardium due to respiratory motion, signal inhomogeneity within the thorax, and short transverse relaxation times. Recently developed accelerated diffusion‐weighted MR acquisition sequences combined with advanced post‐processing techniques have improved the accuracy and efficiency of diffusion MRI in the myocardium. In this review, we describe the solutions and approaches that have been developed to enable diffusion MRI of the heart
              in vivo
              , including a dual‐gated stimulated echo approach, a velocity‐ (
              M
              1
              ) or an acceleration‐ (
              M
              2
              ) compensated pulsed gradient spin echo approach, and the use of principal component analysis filtering. The structure of the myocardium and the application of these techniques in ischemic heart disease are also briefly reviewed. The advent of clinical MR systems with stronger gradients will likely facilitate the translation of cardiac diffusion MRI into clinical use. The addition of diffusion MRI to the well‐established set of cardiovascular imaging techniques should lead to new and complementary approaches for the diagnosis and evaluation of patients with heart disease. © 2015 The Authors.
